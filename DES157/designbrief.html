    <h2>Comparison Project 1: </h2>
    <p> <a href="https://foundation.gucci.com">The Website</a>  has the layout I am interested in, and what I found useful is that they allow viewers to click on the frame, and then the video will play within the frame. Very fun to interact. The scrolling however is very boring, it feels a bit like they spent a huge amount of time on the front page.

    <h2> Comparison Project 2</h2>
    <p><a href="This website">The Website</a> is a bit confusing to navigate, I was not sure if I should scroll down or click on the tabs. However, at one part, I was able to hover over the black and white image, and it actually shows color when I hover over it, which is really cool.
